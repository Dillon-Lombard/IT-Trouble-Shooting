## 1. Problem Description

A client reported that their internet was not providing sufficient speed and that the connection was **intermittent over time**.

**Reported symptoms:**

- Internet speeds were inconsistent and lower than expected.
- The connection dropped in and out at different times.
- The problem affected the client's devices generally, not just one.

**Impact:** The client could not rely on their internet connection for normal use.

---

## 2. Initial Assessment

Intermittent, slow internet across multiple devices points to a problem somewhere between the service provider and the devices. The likely causes were:

- A fault with the internet service provider (ISP) line or fiber connection
- A faulty or failing router
- Interference or a configuration issue

**Plan:** Test the connection from different points in the network to isolate where the fault is.

## 3. Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Tested the router** and checked its status and behavior.
2. **Ran speed tests on three different devices** (laptop, mobile phone, and tablet) over the router's connection. The results were **far below expected speeds and inconsistent** throughout the testing period on all three devices, which ruled out a single faulty device.
3. **Connected the laptop directly to the ISP's fiber box** with a cable, bypassing the router entirely, and ran another speed test. Speeds were **sufficient and matched what the client's plan should deliver.** This showed the ISP line and fiber connection were working correctly, and that the fault was in the router.
4. **Tested with a separate router.** Set it up from new, contacted the ISP to obtain the login details needed for the connection, and entered them into the new router.
5. **Re-tested speeds** on the connected devices to confirm performance.

## 4. Resolution

After the replacement router was configured with the ISP login details, internet speeds returned to normal and the connection was stable. The client had no further issues.

**Root cause:** Faulty client router, which was degrading speed and causing intermittent connectivity.

**Fix applied:** Replaced the router with a new unit and configured it using the credentials supplied by the ISP.

---

## 5. Recommendations for the Client

- Replace routers every few years, as older hardware can degrade over time.
- Keep the ISP login details stored somewhere safe for future router changes.
- Place the router in a central, open location away from walls, metal objects, and other electronics.
- If speeds drop again, test with a cable directly to the fiber box to quickly tell whether the problem is the router or the ISP.

## 6. Skills Demonstrated

- Systematic fault isolation (devices, router, ISP line)
- Running and comparing speed tests across multiple devices
- Wired vs. wireless connection testing
- Router replacement and configuration with ISP credentials
- Working with an ISP to obtain account and login details
- Verifying the fix and advising the client
